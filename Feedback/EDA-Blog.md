## Feedback

The initial feedback that I received that I knew I needed to work on was the content of my EDA. I had some really cool charts put on my blog, but did not have very good explanations about what was going on and why certain charts were important. 

One student suggested that I make my charts smaller for easier readability

Another suggested that I try to make more charts on comparisons between companies to tell a better story

One suggested that I use more of the numeric data instead of just counts.

## Improvements

One things I could not figure out was how to make my charts smaller for the blog. On my screen they looked fine though so I thought I would just keep it. I was able to write captions and explanantions to all of my charts so the blog is more engaging. I also added a couple new charts and rearranged the order so tha it would tell a better story. Fixed some grammatical errors that a friend pointed out as well.
