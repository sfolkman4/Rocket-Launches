# Data Collection Blog Feedback

SHA number of original Data Collection blog post: SHA: d19e0da9b88a4fab9bb1fe5b1e5a1fd0e1987037

My original blog post had some pretty big flaws. I initially thought that that I had filled the requirements for a Tier 1 project but turns out I was reading about the Tier 5. 

## Feedback

Most of the feedback that I got on my blog as about my data collection and getting more data out of the API. One suggested that I try and get a categorical variable on types of rockets being sent up which I thought was a really good idea. Another student recommended that I try to make a map of launch locations instead of just having their name. I also got feedback to make my code chunks colored and easier to read.

## Improvements

I was able to improve my script to make a more complex dataset. I have multiple columns of numeric and categorical variables now which will make for a better EDA and Dashboard. I was able to get the latitude and longitude for each of the launches but haven't done map plots in pyhton so am curious to see how that will work. I also made some changes with headings and text as well as added links to my github and other blogs.
