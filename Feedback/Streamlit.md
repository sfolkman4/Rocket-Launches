## Feedback

The Feedback that I got from my streamlit was that my charts were a little too different from my EDA charts that I had made. I think I really wanted to take advantage of the filtering options that you can have when making a streamlit dashboard, so I went a little crazy and made it super specific for what you could look at. 

One student recommended that I add the map in and make it so it shows where companies launch from. 

Andy told me to potentially add a slider so I could look at specific companies above or below a certain launch number or even for the mission type data so that I am not just looking at the top 5 but can compare the others better as well

Another student recommended that I use the image column that I got from the data

## Improvements

I added the map from my EDA onto the streamlit app so that you can see more information about launch locations. The map shows the point of where the launch location is at and below tells you how many pads are at that site. I thought this was especially interesting so I kept it. 

I also added so that whenever you select a company, you can see the image of their most recent launch. 

I tried to add a slider but in my opinion it made the dashbaord less usable and more confusing so I decided to move forward without it.
