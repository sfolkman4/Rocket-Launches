# Final Project Topic Selection

For my project I came up with a couple project ideas that I was super interested in. After my internship this summmer, I wanted to do something that was related to blockchain.

Topics:

1. Token comparison. ETH vs SOL
2. NFT Prices and market
3. Crypto Market Comparison

# Feedback 

All the feedback that I got was pretty positive since none of the people that gave me feedback knew much about crypto data. What I realized after starting to look at the data was that it was really hard to find data to work with that I can really do a good analysis on.

After debating what to do, I decided to change my project to look at rocket launch data. Since I used this data for another class I already knew that it would be good to use for this project.
